s:1284:"<p>The chat activity module enables participants to have text-based, real-time synchronous discussions.</p>

<p>The chat may be a one-time activity or it may be repeated at the same time each day or each week. Chat sessions are saved and can be made available for everyone to view or restricted to users with the capability to view chat session logs.</p>

<p>Chats are especially useful when the group chatting is not able to meet face-to-face, such as</p>

<ul>
<li>Regular meetings of learners participating in online courses to enable them to share experiences with others in the same course but in a different location.</li>
<li>A learner temporarily unable to attend in person chatting with their trainer to catch up with work.</li>
<li>Learners out on work placement/in-field deployments getting together to discuss their experiences with each other and their trainer.</li>
<li>A question and answer session with an invited speaker in a different location.</li>
<li>Sessions to help learners prepare for exams where the trainer, or other learners, would pose sample questions.</li>
</ul>
