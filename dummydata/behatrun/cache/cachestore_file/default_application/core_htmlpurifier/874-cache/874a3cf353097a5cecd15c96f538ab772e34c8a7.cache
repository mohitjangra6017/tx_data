<p>Choice results may be published after learners have answered, after a certain date, or not at all. Results may be published with learner names or anonymously.</p>

<p>A choice activity may be used:</p>

<ul>
<li>As a quick poll to stimulate thinking about a topic.</li>
<li>To quickly test learners' understanding.</li>
<li>To facilitate learner decision-making, for example allowing learners to vote on a direction for the course.</li>
</ul>
