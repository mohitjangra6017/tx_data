s:1391:"<p>The database activity module enables participants to create, maintain and search a collection of entries (i.e. records).  The structure of the entries is defined by the trainer as a number of fields. Field types include checkbox, radio buttons, dropdown menu, text area, URL, picture, and uploaded file.</p>

<p>The visual layout of information when listing, viewing, or editing database entries may be controlled by database templates. Database activities may be shared between courses as presets and a trainer may also import and export database entries.</p>

<p>If the database auto-linking filter is enabled, any entries in a database will be automatically linked where the words or phrases appear within the course.</p>

<p>A trainer can allow comments on entries. Entries can also be rated by trainers or learners (peer evaluation). Ratings can be aggregated to form a final grade which is recorded in the gradebook.</p>

<p>Database activities have many uses, such as</p>

<ul>
<li>A collaborative collection of web links, books, book reviews, journal references etc.</li>
<li>For displaying learner-created images, reports, websites, or articles for peer comment and review.</li>
</ul>
