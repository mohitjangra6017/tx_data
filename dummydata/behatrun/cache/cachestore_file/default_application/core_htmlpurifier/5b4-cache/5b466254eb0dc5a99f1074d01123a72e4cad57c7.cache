s:908:"<p>The file module enables a trainer to provide a file as a course resource. Where possible, the file will be displayed within the course interface; otherwise learners will be prompted to download it. The file may include supporting files, for example an HTML page may have embedded images or Flash objects.</p>

<p>Note that learners need to have the appropriate software on their computers in order to open the file.</p>

<p>A file may be used:</p>

<ul>
<li>To share presentations given in face-to-face sessions.</li>
<li>To include a mini website as a course resource.</li>
<li>To provide draft files of certain software programs (eg Photoshop .psd) so learners can edit and submit them for assessment.</li>
</ul>
