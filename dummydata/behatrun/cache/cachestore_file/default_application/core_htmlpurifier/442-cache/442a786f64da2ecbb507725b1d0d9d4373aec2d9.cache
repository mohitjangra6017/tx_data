s:952:"<p>The URL module enables a trainer to provide a web link as a course resource. Anything that is freely available online, such as documents or images, can be linked to; the URL doesn't have to be the home page of a website. The URL of a particular web page may be copied and pasted or a trainer can use the file picker and choose a link from a repository such as Flickr, YouTube, or Wikimedia (depending upon which repositories are enabled for the site).</p>

<p>There are a number of display options for the URL, such as embedded or opening in a new window and advanced options for passing information, such as a learner's name, to the URL if required.</p>

<p>Note that URLs can also be added to any other resource or activity type through the text editor.</p>
