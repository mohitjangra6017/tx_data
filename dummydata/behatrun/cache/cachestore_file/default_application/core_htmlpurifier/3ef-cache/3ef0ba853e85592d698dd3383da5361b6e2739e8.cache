s:1397:"<p>The glossary activity module enables participants to create and maintain a list of definitions, like a dictionary, or to collect and organise resources or information.A trainer can allow files to be attached to glossary entries. Attached images are displayed in the entry. Entries can be searched or browsed alphabetically or by category, date, or author. Entries can be approved by default or require approval by a trainer before they are viewable by everyone.If the glossary auto-linking filter is enabled, entries will be automatically linked where the concept words and/or phrases appear within the course.A trainer can allow comments on entries. Entries can also be rated by trainers or learners (peer evaluation). Ratings can be aggregated to form a final grade which is recorded in the gradebook.</p>
