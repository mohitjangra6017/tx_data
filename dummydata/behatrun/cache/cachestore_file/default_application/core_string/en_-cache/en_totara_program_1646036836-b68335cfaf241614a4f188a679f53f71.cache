Once sets are added the relationships between them can be defined. Sets can be created from manually adding courses, selecting a predefined competency or setting up a single course with recurrence.

Once a number of sets have been created, set dividers are employed to allow the creation of sequences (i.e. dependencies) between each set. An example program with four course sets defined could have dependencies as follows:

*   From set one the learner must complete one course (courseA or courseB) before proceeding to set two.
*   From set two the learner must complete all courses (courseC and courseD and courseE) before proceeding to set three or set four.
*   From set three the learner must complete one course (courseE) or all courses from set four (courseF and courseG).

Once the learning path is completed, the learner has finished the program.

Sets can be created by adding:

* **Set of courses**: Allows creation of multiple sets of courses with dependencies.
* **Competency **: Allows creation of multiple sets of courses from predefined competency evidence. When a competency is used to create a set, it becomes rigid and cannot be changed.
* **Single course**: Forces the allowance of a single course with recurrence. Once a set of courses or competency is chosen, the single course with recurrence is removed from the list.";s:17:"affectedusercount";s:46:"Number of learners affected by these changes: ";s:23:"afterprogramiscompleted";s:26:"After program is completed";s:17:"afterprogramisdue";s:20:"After program is due";s:13:"aftersetisdue";s:16:"After set is due";s:8:"allbelow";s:9:"All below";s:13:"allbelowlower";s:9:"all below";s:10:"allcourses";s:11:"All courses";s:14:"allcoursesfrom";s:16:"all courses from";s:25:"allextensionrequestissues";s:30:"All "extension request" issues";s:11:"alllearners";s:12:"All learners";s:30:"allowedtimeforprogramaslearner";s:67:"You are allowed {$a->num} {$a->periodstr} to complete this program.";s:30:"allowedtimeforprogramasmanager";s:88:"{$a->fullname} will require at least {$a->num} {$a->periodstr} to complete this program.";s:29:"allowedtimeforprograminfinity";s:48:"There is no time limit to complete this program.";s:28:"allowedtimeforprogramviewing";s:72:"A learner is allowed {$a->num} {$a->periodstr} to complete this program.";s:22:"allowextensionrequests";s:24:"Allow extension requests";s:27:"allowextensionrequests_help";s:124:"When enabled, learners can submit extension requests for this program which can then be approved or denied by their manager.";s:30:"allowextensionrequestsdisabled";s:129:"Program extension requests are disabled.

The score is calculated by summing the values from the **Course score field** for all the courses a user has completed.

It is used to determine if the completion period set on the **assignments** tab is realistic for a particular group of users. If the assignment is not realistic, a **time allowance** exception will be generated and the user will not be assigned to the program until the exception has been resolved.

For example, consider a program consisting of a single course set with a minimum time required of 10 days. If a user was assigned with completion criteria that required them to complete it in less than 10 days, then it would raise an exception report for that user.

When using completion criteria relative to a user, it is possible for some users to generate exceptions but not others. For example, when using the **days since first login** criteria, each user would have their own deadline that may or may not be realistic.

When multiple course sets exist in a program the overall minimum time required for the program is calculated based on the worst-case scenario taking into account the course set logic. For example if a program consists of:

Course set1 [10 days] THEN Course set2 [5 days] OR Course set3 [7 days]

then the overall time allowance would be 17 days.
