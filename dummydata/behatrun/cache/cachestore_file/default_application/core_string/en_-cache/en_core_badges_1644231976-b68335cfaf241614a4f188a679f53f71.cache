It may be that your firewall prevents access from users outside your network, your site is password protected, or you are running the site on a computer that is not available from the Internet (such as a local development machine).

You should fix this issue on any production site where you are planning to issue badges, otherwise the recipients will not be able to prove they earned their badges from you. If your site is not yet live you can create and issue test badges, as long as the site is accessible before you go live.

**What if I can't make my whole site publicly accessible?**
