information provided here is intended especially for developers.

=== 14.4 ===

* Deprecated totara_notification\local\helper::is_resolver_enabled - this function isn't needed and isn't returning
  the correct value when no preference record is found.
* Deprecated totara_notification\local\helper::is_resolver_enabled_for_all_parent_contexts - use
  is_resolver_disabled_by_any_context instead, and pass in the parent context of your target context if you want
  to know explicitly whether an ancestor is causing the target to be disabled.

=== 14.1 ===

* Deprecated the function single_emptiable_placeholder::get_representation_string_for_empty - all empty placeholder
  values are now automatically replaced with the 'no_available_data_for_key' string when they are used.
