An example certification with four course sets defined could have dependencies as follows:

* From set two the learner must complete all courses (courseC and courseD and courseE) before proceeding to set three or set four.

* **Use certification expiry date**: Uses the last expiry date to calculate the next.

* **Use fixed expiry date**: This option causes the expiry time to be calculated based on the specified assignment due date (if available, otherwise the **first** completion date), and subsequent completion expiry dates will be calculated using that same base date, regardless of whether they are late or early.

It is used to determine if the completion period set on the **assignments** tab is realistic for a particular group of users. If the assignment is not realistic, a **time allowance** exception will be generated and the user will not be assigned to the certification until the exception has been resolved.

For example, consider a certification consisting of a single course set with a minimum time required of 10 days. If a user was assigned with completion criteria that required them to complete it in less than 10 days, then it would raise an exception report for that user.

When using completion criteria relative to a user, it is possible for some users to generate exceptions but not others. For example, when using the **days since first login** criteria, each user would have their own deadline that may or may not be realistic.

When multiple course sets exist in a certification the overall minimum time required for the certification is calculated based on the worst-case scenario taking into account the course set logic. For example if a certification consists of:

Course set1 [10 days] THEN Course set2 [5 days] OR Course set3 [7 days]

then the overall time allowance would be 17 days.

This minimum time value is also used to determine when the \'Course set due message\' and \'Course set overdue message\' should be sent.';

It could have been caused in previous versions when a user was certified, before the recertification window opened, the user was then unassigned, and later re-assigned. If the record has a history completion record (most likely marked \'unassigned\') then this is likely the cause. In this case, you should manually edit the completion record, copying the details of the history record, then remove the history record. This will restore the user into the certification in the state that they were in before being unassigned.<br>
If no history record exists, use the automatic fix to change the program completion record to \'incomplete\'. Users will be put into the primary certification path, but might automatically be marked certified again by cron, depending on the state of their courses (which are likely still marked complete). Beware that clicking this link will apply the change to all currently selected records. If some records need to be fixed using the method above, they should be done first, or you could activate this fix while editing a single completion record.';
