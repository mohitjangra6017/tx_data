  "description": "<p>Suppose someone you work with or someone you love were to have a seizure. Would you know what was happening? Moreover, would you know what to do? In this six-module course you’ll learn the general steps to take when someone is having a seizure, and the specific first aid steps for tonic-clonic, complex partial, absence, and tonic/atonic seizures. You’ll also learn what to do if a seizure occurs in water and how to help someone who is having a seizure while in a wheelchair.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A short quiz follows each module, and a final assessment concludes the course.</p>",
