      | fullname    | shortname | idnumber |
      | Program One | prog1     | prog1    |

    And the following "courses" exist:

      | progman | progmanager | Program       | prog1     |

  Scenario: program manager not allows to edit program notification
    Given the following "permission overrides" exist:
      | capability                           | permission | role          | contextlevel | reference |
      | totara/program:configuredetails      | Allow      | progmanager   | Program      | prog1     |
    And I log in as "progman"
    And I am on "Program One" program homepage
    When I press "Edit program details"
    Then I should not see "Notifications"
    And I log out

  Scenario: totara/program:configuremessages allows a user to edit program notification
    Given the following "permission overrides" exist:
      | capability                           | permission | role          | contextlevel | reference |
      | totara/program:configuremessages     | Allow      | progmanager   | Program      | prog1     |
    And I log in as "progman"
    And I am on "Program One" program homepage
