      | name  | description          | idnumber | proficient | default | sortorder |
      | Great | Is great at doing it | great    | 1          | 0       | 1         |
      | Good  | Is ok at doing it    | good     | 0          | 0       | 2         |

      | fullname                         | idnumber    | description                | scale |
      | Competency Framework             | fw1         | Framework for Competencies | ggb   |
      | Single item competency framework | single_item | Framework for Competencies | ggb   |
    And the following "competency" hierarchy exists:
      | framework   | fullname           | idnumber           | description                   | parent |
      | fw1         | Parent             | parent             | Parent competency             |        |

      | single_item | Single item parent | Single item parent | Single item parent competency |        |
