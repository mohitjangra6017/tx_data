=== 14.0 ===

* Perform container categories are now created upon installation, instead of created on-demand
* Created a 'container_perform' enrol plugin class that is automatically enabled for every perform container.
  It is not a 'real' plugin, but simulates the enrolment of users in a performance activity.
  See the perform_enrollment class for more details.
