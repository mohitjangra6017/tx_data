      | activity_name        | description                         | activity_type | create_track | create_section | activity_status | anonymous_responses |
      | Aggregation Activity | We will average and sum some values | check-in      | true         | false          | Draft           | true                |
    And the following "activity sections" exist in "mod_perform" plugin:
