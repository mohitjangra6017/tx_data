=== 14.0 ===

* Renamed element from "Long text" to "Text: Long response"
* This element now uses the Weka WYSIWYG editor (including file support) rather than a simple textbox.
  JSON response data and files are now handled by long_text class rather than just plain text.
* answer_length_exceeded_error is now deprecated as there is now no limit on the response length
* long_text::post_response_submission() has been deprecated and should no longer be used. It has been replaced
  with the \mod_perform\hook\post_element_response_submission hook, which is watched by long_text::process_weka_response()
* Mutation prepare_draft_area has been deprecated and should no longer be used. It has been replaces with Query get_draft_id.
