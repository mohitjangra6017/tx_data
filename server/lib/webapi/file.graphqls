    A mutation to fetch the unused draft item id.
    This is mutation because, if it is a query, apollo-client will try to squeeze
    the multiple requests into one - as they are identical to each other.
    Hence, mutation will be better because it will assure that each of query within multiple
    instnaces to be executed.

    Note that: `fetchPolicy: 'no-cache'` does not help at all.
