This files describes API changes in /search/*,
information provided here is intended especially for developers.

=== 13.0 ===

* Search indexing now supports time limits to make the scheduled task run more neatly. In order for
  this to work, search engine plugins will need to implement the 'stopat' parameter if they
  override the add_documents() function, and return an extra parameter from this function (see base
  class in engine.php). Unmodified plugins will still work, but without supporting time limits.

=== 12.0 ===

* String helpers are no longer used in the following templates, string data is passed via context data:
** search/templates/result.mustache

=== 10.0 ===

* Base search area classes have been renamed, please update your search areas to use the classes below:
  - \core_search\area\base has been renamed to \core_search\base
  - \core_search\area\base_mod has been renamed to \core_search\base_mod
  - \core_search\area\base_activity has been renamed to \core_search\base_activity
